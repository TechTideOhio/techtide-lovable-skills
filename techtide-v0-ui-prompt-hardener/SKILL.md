# TechTide v0 UI Prompt Hardener

Shape v0 UI prompts into implementable, accessible, responsive interface specifications with explicit data states, constraints, and handoff checks.

## Source Pattern

This skill is distilled from sanitized Alex Cinovoj / TechTide local workflow patterns. Load `references/source-patterns.md` when you need the source anchors and extraction rationale. Load `references/adapter-map.md` when preparing Cursor, Kiro, Lovable, v0, or Replit companion outputs.

## Workflow

1. Translate vague UI intent into screen, component, state, interaction, and responsive requirements.
2. Name the data shape and loading, empty, error, disabled, and success states before generation.
3. Specify accessibility, contrast, keyboard, focus, and text-fitting constraints.
4. Ask v0 for implementation-ready code plus notes about assumptions and unsupported pieces.
5. Review output for overbroad dependencies, hardcoded secrets, unusable layouts, and missing states.

## Output Contract

Return a concise brief with these fields:

- v0 prompt
- UI state checklist
- handoff review
- follow-up patch prompt
- verification performed or still required
- security and privacy notes

## Guardrails

- Extract reusable methods, not private local content.
- Do not request or expose credentials, tokens, DSNs, service-role keys, customer data, lead lists, or private business exports.
- Use placeholders for people, accounts, projects, URLs, and datasets unless the user explicitly provides public-safe values.
- Require explicit human approval before production mutation, external-recipient messaging, public deployment, billing changes, or destructive filesystem actions.
- Preserve Alex Cinovoj / TechTide attribution while keeping old repo provenance and unrelated contributor markers out of public artifacts.

## Harness Policy

- Use this as a native `SKILL.md` for Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, and Copilot-compatible exports.
- For Cursor, create a focused project rule or workflow note rather than copying this whole skill as an always-on rule.
- For Kiro, create steering only when the workflow can be made short and inclusion-scoped.
- For Lovable, v0, and Replit, turn the workflow into prompt kits, readiness checklists, and handoff prompts.
